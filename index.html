  <hr>
  <p>Seekers: The Quest Begins is a book by Erin Hunter. It is about three bears, living in seperate parts of the world. <br>One of them is Kallik, the polar bear. She lives on the ice with her mother, Nisa, and her playful brother, Taqqiq. When the ice melts earlier than usual, the three set out for dry land. When disaster strikes, Kallik must go out on her own into the wild. <br>The second bear is Toklo. He is a brown bear living with his mother and very ill brother. He wishes to be free, for his mother pays little attention to him and teaches him little, only paying attention to his sick brother. <br>The final bear is Lusa, a black bear. She lives in the Vancouver Zoo. After seeing that there is much more to the world than she thought, she wishes to be out in the open wild. But life out there is harder than she thought...</p>
