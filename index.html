  <p>Seekers: The Quest Begins is a book by Erin Hunter. It is about three bears, living in seperate parts of the world. <br>One of them is Kallik, the polar bear. She lives on the ice with her mother, Nisa, and her playful brother, Taqqiq. When the ice melts earlier than usual, the three set out for dry land. Then, disaster strikes, and Kallik must go out on her own to find her brother after she loses him. <br>Another one of the three bears is Toklo. He lives with his mother and very sick brother. His mother pays her attention only to his brother, Tobi. When Tobi eventually dies, Toklo leaves his mother and begins his life as an independant bear.<br>The final bear is Lusa, a black bear. She lives in the Vancouver Zoo. After seeing that there is much more to the world than she thought, she wishes to be out in the open wild. But life out there is harder than she thought...</p>
